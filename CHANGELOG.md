-   `Staking`
    -   Changes applied to enhance our scores on SEO, Accessibility and best practices based on lighthouse report for desktop.
    -   A fix was applied to keep the pool-info tab selected when the user access the staking pool users page.

## [2.12.4] - 2022-12-19

-   We updated the calculation for CTSI staked on staking pool users page. A wallet connection is not required to see the total CTSI staked by each address.
-   We fixed a problem on stake page. Where the input inside the modal for deposit and stake would be stale after the user closed it. That forced the user to erase the value and type again so the button would be enabled again.
